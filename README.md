# custom-dataset-aid

Helps to create custom dataset files to feed to a conv. neural network - takes a subimage using a frame as reference. Resize the frame using WASD, and move it with mouse clicks. The script will then save the image from the frame, alongside a complete black and white version when P key is pressed/held.

Used in my food-processor-robot project (https://github.com/warisz/food-processor-robot)
