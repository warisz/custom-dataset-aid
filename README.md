# custom-dataset-aid

Helps to create dataset files to feed to a neural network - takes a subimage using the blue box as reference. Resize the box using WASD, and move it with mouse clicks. Save the image by pressing P key. 

The script will then save the image from the box, alongside a complete black and white version of it for more simple conv neural nets. Used in my food-processor-robot project (https://github.com/warisz/food-processor-robot)
